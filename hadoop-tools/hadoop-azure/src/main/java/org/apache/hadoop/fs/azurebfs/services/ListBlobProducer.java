/**
 * ListBlob API can give maximum of 5000 blobs. If there are (~n*5000) blobs, the
 * client would need to call the listBlob API n times. This would have two consequences:
 * <ol>
 *   <li>
 *     The consumer of the result of lists of blob would have to wait until all
 *     the blobs are received. The consumer could have used the time to start
 *     processing the blobs already in memory. The wait for receiving all the blobs
 *     would lead the processing more time. Lets say consumer need m time-units to process
 *     one blob. Lets assume that each set of blobs have x blobs. In total there
 *     have to be n sets Lets say that client needs t time to get all the blobs. If consumer
 *     wait for all the blobs to be received, the total time taken would be:
 *     <pre>t + (n * x * m)</pre>
 *     Now, lets assume that consumer in parallel work on the available the blobs,
 *     time taken would be:
 *     <pre>t + (((n * x) - t/m) * m)</pre>
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *     Since the information of the blobs have to be maintained in memory until the
 *     computation on the list is done. On low configuration machine, it may lead
 *     to OOM.
 *   </li>
 * </ol>
 * In this design, the producer on a parallel thread to the main thread, will call
 * ListBlob API and will populate {@link ListBlobQueue}, which would be dequeued by
 * the main thread which will run the computation on the available blobs.<br>
 *
 * How its different from {@link AbfsListStatusRemoteIterator}?<br>
 * It provides an iterator which on {@link AbfsListStatusRemoteIterator#hasNext()} checks
 * if there are blobs available in memory. If not it will call Listing API on server for
 * the next set of blobs. But here, it make the process sequential. As in, when the processing
 * on whole set of blobs available in memory are done, after that only next set of blobs are
 * fetched.
